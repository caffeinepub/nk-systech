  "summary": "Most frontend requirements appear implemented: single-page responsive nav (desktop + mobile), hero/about/services/contact sections, services cards with “Sales & Service”, product category listing, footer with quick links and placeholders, and UI references to generated images. Key gaps/risks are in the backend inquiry storage (not stable) and the backend ServiceInterest enum not matching the requested NK SYSTECH service interests. Image assets themselves are not evidenced as added under the required public path (diff omits some files).",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Backend stores inquiries in stable state and exposes a method to create an inquiry and a method to list inquiries.",
      "reason": "The backend uses an in-memory Map and a mutable counter without stable persistence; no `stable var` or upgrade-safe persistence is shown, so inquiries would be lost on upgrade/reinstall and do not meet the 'stable state' AC.",

      "requirement": "Service interest values should align to NK SYSTECH offerings (CCTV, Workstations, Networking, Laptops, Computers, Other) for dropdown submission/storage.",
      "reason": "The backend ServiceInterest variant names are unrelated (energyTransition, renewableEnergyConsulting, etc.), and the frontend maps CCTV/workstations/etc. labels onto these unrelated backend enum variants, indicating the backend model does not actually represent the requested service interests.",

      "reason": "Frontend references the expected asset paths, but the diff summary does not include the actual added static image files under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (some added files were omitted due to limits), so presence/placement cannot be verified from the provided diff.",
