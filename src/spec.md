# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide direct phone and WhatsApp contact options in the Contact section so visitors can reach NK SYSTECH without relying on email delivery.

**Planned changes:**
- Add two prominent buttons in the Contact section (id: `contact`): “Call Now” (`href="tel:9080250925"`) and “WhatsApp” (`https://wa.me/919080250925`, opens in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
- Add a short English helper line in the Contact section clarifying that visitors can either submit the inquiry form or contact directly via phone/WhatsApp (without implying inquiries are delivered to email).
- Ensure the new buttons work well on mobile and desktop and do not disrupt the existing inquiry form flow.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can choose to submit the inquiry form or contact NK SYSTECH instantly via a Call Now button or a WhatsApp chat link from the Contact section.
